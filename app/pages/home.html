    <h1 class="Main-text">Main Information</h1>
    <p class="Second-text">LightSB (Light Schrödinger Bridge) is an advanced machine learning solution designed to tackle problems related to optimal transport and complex system modeling. This tool is highly efficient and flexible, applicable in fields such as image processing, data analysis, and simulation of systems with nonlinear dependencies.</p>
    <p class="Second-text">The project offers a fast and lightweight implementation of Schrödinger bridge algorithms, significantly accelerating task execution. LightSB supports various data transport methods and can be used for translating images between different categories—for example, transforming high-resolution faces (male to female, adult to child) within the ALAE model space.</p>

    <p class="Second-text">The LightSB project has gained recognition in the scientific community and has been presented at leading machine learning conferences such as ICML 2024 and ICLR 2024. Key publications include:</p>
