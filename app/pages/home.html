    <p class="Second-text">LightSB-service project is designed to help engineers to solve domain translation tasks.</p>
    <p class="Second-text">LightSB (Light Schrödinger Bridge) is an advanced machine learning solution designed to tackle problems related to optimal transport and complex system modeling. LightSB is used for mapping between distributions with entropy regularization.</p>
    <p class="Second-text">In this project, LightSB serves to learn a probabilistic mapping between two data distributions in a structured latent space, enabling controlled and diverse domain translation.</p>
    <p class="Second-text">Latents being trained to translate young people face latents to old people face latents within the ALAE latent space.
    <p class="Second-text">The "Generator" section is designed to apply the trained model on new photos to generate aged people.
    <p class="Second-text">The project offers a fast and lightweight implementation of Schrödinger bridge algorithms, significantly accelerating task execution. LightSB supports various data transport methods and can be used for translating images between different categories—for example, transforming high-resolution faces (male to female, adult to child).</p>
    <p class="Second-text">The LightSB project has gained recognition in the scientific community and has been presented at leading machine learning conferences such as ICML 2024 and ICLR 2024. Key publications include:</p>
